# TODO: Look into removing this. "find" used to get required from common's
# gemspec so we've added it here for backwards compatability during bundler 2
# rollout.
#
# NOTE: If we don't require it and a customers `.gemspec` uses Find without
# requiring it, we'll start raising a DependencyFileNotEvaluatable error which
# is probably the right thing to do
require "find"

# NOTE: This is intentionally left blank as it's currently only used to force
# bundler to use v1 when executing native helpers by pointing the BUNDLE_GEMFILE
# env to this Gemfile in Dependabot::Bundler::NativeHelpers
